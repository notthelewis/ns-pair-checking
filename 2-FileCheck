## The IF conditional in line 29 can be broken down as such:

## The start %2 = 0 parameter checks if it's an even number. This is to break each pair of domains to a confined pair. 
## I.e. domain and domain.zone should be checked but domain.zone should not be checked against domain2. 
##  $(($start %2)) == 0 means if the number of the current position in the array is evenly divisible by 2
## "${lines[$start]}" != "${lines[$start+1]}" means, if the current article at this position is not equal to the one after it. 

# Initializes a fixed loop the length of the total number of domains.
